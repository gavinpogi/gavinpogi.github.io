After signing the NBA star in 2019, Jordan Brand is partnering with Jayson Tatum to release his first signature shoe, the Tatum 1. With a lightweight design and responsive foam and Zoom Air cushioning, the Tatum 1 is a well-rounded basketball shoe, whatever the position.

"I want people to feel like they can connect to me", Tatum said. "I remember being a kid, walking into the store and looking for the signature shoes of my favourite players. The moment I saw the shoe or put the shoe on, I felt like I was in sync and closer to them in a way. So, I want this shoe to be a bridge between my fans and me, to bring us closer together".

The Jordan Tatum 1 sneaker was born out of Tatum's desire to wear a shoe that feels closely connected to his foot. Built with a lightweight yet strong plastic frame, the shoe is wrapped with foam and features strategically placed rubber for traction on the court.

Nike has unveiled the LeBron 21, the latest installment of the performance footwear collection, built with the next generation of basketball players in mind. Inspired by daughter Zhuri, the shoe features a range of details that aim to support the player throughout the demands of the game.

“As we took our next steps from the LeBron XX, we were inspired by the way LeBron maintains his body and his game during the offseason,” Jason Petrie, Lead Designer for the LeBron 21, said in a press release announcing the shoe launch. “His trainer says it's like taking care of an F1 car. You tweak the car between each race. You don’t need to rebuild the car completely. We wanted to retain some of the elements we know he loved, like the Zoom Turbo unit, but refine some of the finishes in the upper.”

The Luka 1 is designed for the deceptive, off-speed play of Luka Dončić, featuring a new IsoPlate system with full-length Formula 23 performance foam in the midsole. The shoe follows a long line of innovative Jordan Brand performance systems, like the Flight Plate in the Air Jordan XXVIII and the Eclipse Plate debuted in the Air Jordan XXXIV.
